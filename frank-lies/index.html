    <h2>Doctor Frank Lies (1916-1962)</h2>
    <p>Dr. Frank Lies was born into a middle-class family in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon in 1916. Growing up he was close with his mother, and especially his older brother who grew to act as a father figure in his biological fathers absence. He graduated from Jefferson High School in 1933, after skipping a grade, with very high marks. From there, he decided to go to the University of Portland where he studied Psychology and Social Sciences. After graduating, he was offered a job at the university, where he began teaching a course on human emotion. In 1939, he began a secretive personal project on the idea of accidentally telling misinformation, and how someone may be able to use this on purpose. This concluded in 1941, when he made the breakthrough discovery, inventing Lying, named after himself. This invention quickly spread, until eventually everyone was aware of the concept of lying, and unfortunately Frank Lies was mostly forgotten.</p>
